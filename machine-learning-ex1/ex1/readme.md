# Linear Regression With One Feature
* plotdata.m can plot a graph with scatter dot
* ex1data1.txt is the data text
* gradientDescent.m is to compute the perfect theta(parameter)
* computeCost.m is compute the cost of a particular choice of theta

# Linear Regression With Multiple Feature
* ex1data2.txt is the data text
* featureNormalize.m defines a function that processing some step to make feature normalized
* normalEqn.m is directly compute a proper theta
* gradientDescentMulti.m is using gradient descent to fetch the proper theta
